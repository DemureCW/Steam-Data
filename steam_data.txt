# A tree-based representation of the Steam client's settings in it's internal files.
#
# The ../Steam/registry.vdf file only exists on Mac and Linux versions of Steam; it is a
#   VDF-based replacement of the registry data of Steam on Windows. To access that data
#   on Windows RegEdit or another registry editing application must be used.
#
# Note: The setting "Run Steam when my computer starts" is not stored in the Steam client files on all systems.
# On Mac: It's stored in the Login Items, which can be edited by going to System Preferences -> Users & Groups -> Login Items.
# On Windows: It's part of the [Startup Programs](https://www.howtogeek.com/74523/how-to-disable-startup-programs-in-windows/).
# On Linux: If you're good enough to game here you're far smarter than I, and I believe you can find this.
